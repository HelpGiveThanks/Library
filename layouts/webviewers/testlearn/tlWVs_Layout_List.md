The reference table has web viewers on its layouts below (L01 = layout number for Library v3.1 beta).

* Folder name reference = layout table.
* File names (ex: filename path.md) = the names of the related tables sourcing the picture, movie, etc., minus the 'path' and 'URL' tags.
* The **path** tag (ex: filename **path**.md) = web viewers that reference files on local hard drives, computers, etc.
* The **URL** tags (ex: filename **URL**.md) = web viewers referencing files on the web.
