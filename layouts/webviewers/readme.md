Each web-viewer folder contains

1. A file for every web-viewer's table related to the layout's table on which it appears.  

  The folder names (ex: tempSetup) = layout tables.

  File names (ex: filename path.md) = the names of the related tables sourcing the picture, movie, etc., minus the 'path' and 'URL' tags.  

  The **path** tag (ex: filename **path**.md) = web viewers that reference files on local hard drives, computers, etc.

  The **URL** tags (ex: filename **URL**.md) = web viewers referencing files on the web.

3. The webviewer-list file, lists every layout in the library solution with webviewers on them.

2. And, of course, the readme.md file in each folder explains the folder contents, repeating most of this information.
