Each web-viewer folder contains

1. A file for every web-viewer used on a specific table's layouts.  

  The folder names (ex: tempSetup) = these specific layout tables.

  The file names (ex: filename path.md) = the names of the tables sourcing the picture, movie, etc., minus the 'path' and 'URL' tags.  

  The path tag (ex: filename path.md) = web viewers that reference files on local hard drives, computers, etc.

  The URL tags (ex: filename URL.md) = web viewers referencing files on the web.

3. The webviewer-list file lists every layout in the library solution with webviewers on them.

2. And, of course, the readme.md file in each folder explains the folder contents, repeating most of this information.
