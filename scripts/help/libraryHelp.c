#So there are two help button scripts because I changed
#mind and used an external help module forgetting
#I already had a help button script. So some help buttons
#are attached to one script and some to this one and
#rather than figure this out, I just made this script
#reference other one. As you can see by its name this
#used to take users to an internal library help system.
