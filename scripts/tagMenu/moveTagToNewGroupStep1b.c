#WHEN TIME PERMITS the vocabuary for scripts,
#variable, fields, layouts, etc. needs to be updated
#to reflect that a 'test' is now a 'general inquiry'
#and an 'item' is now a 'specific inquiry' and a 'focus'
#is now a test 'section', etc. A complete look at
#the DDR to insure all vocabulary is updated
#everywhere followed by testing for each
#update is required.
