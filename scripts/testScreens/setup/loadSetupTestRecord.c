#The reason for this whole section of the script
#(getting a test name) is that there is no relationship
#that can be made that would match the key of
#of the named test to this test and thus unlock
#and so allow the layout to show this test's name.
#This is because the key to unlock the display of
#a test's name is in a keychain ﬁeld where many
#keys may exist in a list. Filemaker cannot match
#a lock in one table to list of keys in another table.
#There must be only one key in a ﬁeld in order
#for Filemaker to know which key to use in a lock.
#The database does not have the intellegence or
#programming to search through a list of keys
#to make a match to a lock ﬁeld in another table.
#Thus, in order to display the name of the test in use
#we must have the system put that name in a temp
#ﬁeld with global storage, which then allows it
#to be displayed on any layout where that temp
#ﬁeld is displayed. No relationship between the
#the temp table and the layout's table is required
#as long as the temp ﬁeld is a global ﬁeld, meaning
#all data in the ﬁeld is the same for every record
#in the temp table.
